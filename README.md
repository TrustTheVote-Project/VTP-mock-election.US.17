# A VoteTrackr+ Mock US Election Repo

This is a work in progress.

This repository represents the current thoughts on how to configure an election for VoteTrackerPlus (VTP).  The VTP documentation generally refers to this repo as the ElectionData repo as it is the repo (plus any necessary git submodules) that contains the definition of the election.  It also will store all the blank ballots and cast contest based Cast Vote Records (CVRs) as well as the versioned ballot checks that voters can optionally take with them.

The general layout and relationship of the various VTP repos is described in the [VTP-dev-env](https://github.com/TrustTheVote-Project/VTP-dev-env) repository - see the README there first.

See the [VoteTrackerPlus](https://github.com/TrustTheVote-Project/VoteTrackerPlus) repository for general VTP design and project information - that repo is the primary VTP repo.

See the [developer readme](https://github.com/TrustTheVote-Project/VoteTrackerPlus/tree/main/src/vtp) in the VoteTrackerPlus repo for even more details.
